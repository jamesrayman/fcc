Pop science explanation is wrong
Already achieved
Just for practice
Failed attempts
    Non-determinism
    Using Turing machines
Proof outline
    LIMP and encoding
    Composition Lemma and CIMP
    HALT_0 implies SIM, HALT_ALL
    Define C_i, the i-th computable function
    SIM (LDI 0 x :: to_limp (COMP i)) = C_i x
    HALT_0 implies COMP i is computable
    No-input lemma
    G i := 1 + SIM (LDI 0 i :: to_limp (COMP i)) := 1 + C_i i
    C_j = G
    G j = 1 + G j
Tricky parts
    Encoding programs
    Proving nontrivial equivalences
    Picking a base language
Limitations of Coq
    `intuition` isn't good enough
    Fixpoint definitions are not good enough
